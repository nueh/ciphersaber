### CipherSaber

This is an implementation of CipherSaber-2 in [Purebasic](http://www.purebasic.com).
It compiles on Linux and Mac OS X. [libbsd](http://libbsd.freedesktop.org/wiki/) is recommended on Linux to use `readpassphrase()`, but `getpass()` is also available. Please note that `getpass()` is limited to 128 bytes.

[Purebasic](http://www.purebasic.com) is a commercial BASIC, able to generate small and efficient executables on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. It is not open source -- except the deprecated Amiga variant -- but build by a small team of enthusiastic programmers. The demo version compiles around 800 lines, enough to generate an executable from this source code.


From the [CipherSaber FAQ](http://ciphersaber.gurus.org/faq.html):

#### "What is CipherSaber?"

CipherSaber is an ultra-simple encryption method. Anyone with a little programming skill can write a CipherSaber program in as few as 16 lines of Basic. You can find out how at: http://ciphersaber.gurus.org

#### "Is CipherSaber a serious proposal or are you just trying to make a point?"

Both, actually. The point is that encryption technology is too simple to be suppressed.
