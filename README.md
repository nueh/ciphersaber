This is an implementation of CipherSaber-2 in [Purebasic](http://www.purebasic.com).

From the [CipherSaber FAQ](http://ciphersaber.gurus.org/faq.html):

### "What is CipherSaber?"

CipherSaber is an ultra-simple encryption method. Anyone with a little programming skill can write a CipherSaber program in as few as 16 lines of Basic. You can find out how at: http://ciphersaber.gurus.com

### "Is CipherSaber a serious proposal or are you just trying to make a point?"

Both, actually. The point is that encryption technology is too simple to be suppressed.
